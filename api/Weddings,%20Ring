These alternative metal rings are fast becoming a popular choice in wedding bands for their similarity to platinum in color, yet maintaining the durability of tungsten or titanium. Cobalt has a scratch resistance surface that will not fade or tarnish, nor will it break, shatter or chip.\n Cobalt Chrome is an unique blend that consists of 65% cobalt, 29% chromium and 6% molybdenum. It is a non-magnetic alloy exhibiting high strength, corrosion and wear resistance.\nCobalt rings have color comparable to white gold and platinum jewelry. Moreover, since cobalt rings are not plated with rhodium, which will eventually wear off, they will retain its premium white color forever. The bright white color is lighter than tungsten or titanium and is compared to platinum and white gold in appearance. The weight of cobalt chrome falls between stainless steel and tungsten. All the Cobalt Chrome rings in my shop are designed with a comfort fit.\n\n                                           Celtic Trinity Band\n\nThis unique Cobalt Wedding Ring For Men or Women is lined with Celtic Trinity Knots framed with high polished border.

The number of diamonds depends on the width and size of your ring and they are placed to accentuate the flow of each ring.  TIDEPOOLS is a signature pattern and one of many reasons that STEVEN JACOB Damascus Steel rings are the most original in the world. \n\nA complimentary sizing band will be provided to confirm your ring size for each scattered diamond band ordered within the US.\n\nTIDEPOOLS bands also come in matching men&#39;s sizes.\n\nSHIPS IN 4-5 WEEKS.

We NEVER use copper, brass, carbon steel, wood, bone, plastic, or other inferior materials not suitable for a wedding band you will wear for the rest of your life.\n\n\u2022 We use patented and proprietary manufacturing processes developed by my father and myself that give us a competitive edge in pattern development, material combinations and pricing.\n\n\u2022 We offer the most sophisticated and unique patterns in the world. Contrary to other rings on the market, our rings offer a full 360 degrees of mesmerizing pattern.\n\n\u2022 Unlike many manufacturers, we make rings to last a lifetime. Beware of acid finish Damascus rings and rings with shallow etching that will not protect the darkened areas.\n\n\u2022 Great customer service is a huge priority of ours. Contact us on Etsy and we get back to you as fast as humanly possible. You will be communicating with us personally throughout the whole process.\n\n\u2022 Our rings are not mass manufactured, unlike many of the, so called, handmade Damascus rings you will find on Etsy. Our rings are truly hand crafted works of art, not mass machined parts.\n\n\u2022 All of our rings are sizable and seamless. You will never have to trade it in if your size changes.\n\n\u2022 STEVEN JACOB rings are made with a lustrous comfort fit and rounded edges for ideal wearability.\n\n\u2022 We invite you to compare our rings with any other you may find. We&#39;d be happy to discuss the advantages of our rings with you. You won&#39;t find a better product, period.\n\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS\n\nDamascus Steel is the popular name given to a layered patterned metals technique that was used by ancient blacksmiths to create superior swords, armor, and weaponry because of it&#39;s incredible strength and beauty. The Damascus used for these rings is created in our own shop exclusively for STEVEN JACOB jewelry.\n\nThe two metals used in each ring are permanently forged welded together, then cut, twisted, and formed into a ring. After crafting the ring, we acid etch it to bring out the pattern of the metal and then bead blast it for lustrous matte finish. \n\nOur process for working with this material brings out the best in the pattern and makes each ring a unique work of art. Damascus Steel rings offer the perfect symbol of marriage, of two different elements permanently bonded together to create a whole even more beautiful than it&#39;s parts. \n\nRings are available in widths of 4 to 10 mm, in all standard sizes. We are happy to talk to you about customizing your bands as well, so don&#39;t be shy about asking for exactly what you want.\n\nOur all stainless steel, solid, Damascus rings use type 304 and 316 stainless steel. These are high quality alloys that meet or exceed European Union nickel release standards. You can be confident that our rings will never corrode, rust, discolor, or de-laminate.\n\nWe make all of our rings right here in the US of A and work side by side to create a unique ring for each of our customers. We pride ourselves on our attention to detail and take great care through each step of the process from the forging of the raw Damascus material to the finished ring. We put a lot of thought and work into creating quality, durable rings that will fascinate you for many, many years \u2013 from the way we coax out the very best of the pattern, to how it\u2019s etched surface and rounded contours feel on you hand.

If you prefer the ring in a larger width there is a small upgrade cost, however once your order has been placed we can reach out to you for payment. Please state your desired width in the Notes to Seller section during checkout.\n\nThis ring is available in: TITANIUM, BLACK ZIRCONIUM, SILVER & 14K WHITE, YELLOW, OR ROSE GOLD\n\nThis ring may be pictured in metals that differ from what is stated in the title description. This is to show you what the ring looks like in a different metal, but you can select your desired material from the drop down menu. \n\nWe love taking on custom orders! If you have your own idea for a design send us a message to discuss the specifics. We would love to make something as unique and special as the love you have found.\n\nPOLICIES\n\nLead Time: Our lead time for titanium rings is 8 WEEKS from the date of purchase or 10 WEEKS if you are ordering a ring containing any other metal (silver, black zirconium, etc.).\n\nVariation in Materials: Because we use natural and unique materials in our rings, variation must be expected. No two rings will look the same, making your ring truly unique! Each piece of natural material will have unique patterns, grains, colors, etc.. \n\nSizing: Our rings are true to international sizing standards, within a tenth of a millimeter. Before ordering, we recommend getting sized by two or three reputable jewelers using standard fit rings (not comfort fit) that are the same width as the ring you would like to order from us. Please do not use the thin sizing rings that jewelers have as these are not accurate. If possible, get the millimeter measurement of the inside diameter of the ring that fits with a digital caliper. This will always be the most accurate way for us to size rings. Lastly, do not allow a jeweler to give you a size according to a &quot;ring-sizing dowel&quot;, as in our experience this measuring method and reading be very inconsistent. \n\nIf a ring is ordered in the wrong size WE DO NOT OFFER FREE RESIZING OR REMAKES, so be sure you are sized correctly! Due to the use of natural materials in our rings, most of them cannot be simply resized, they must be rebuilt from scratch.\n\nLIFETIME-LIMITED WARRANTY INFORMATION\n\nWe take pride in our craftsmanship and quality and do everything we can to make our rings as durable as possible. However, the materials we use are natural and thus can be vulnerable to water, chemicals and breakage from impact. For this reason we are offering a lifetime limited warranty, which will give you peace of mind and keep your handcrafted ring protected and looking great for years to come!\n\n**Warranty must be purchased along with your ring or prior to receiving your ring in the mail.\n\nWhat Is Covered & Included?\n\n2 Free Repairs or Remakes (coverage available for the following issues):\n\nWater or Chemical Damage: Your warranty will cover any remakes or repairs of damage to the natural materials caused by water or chemicals.\n\nImpact, Scratching or Accidental Damage:  Your warranty covers all remakes and repairs to natural materials caused by impact, scratching or other accident related abuse.\n\n**We do not offer free coverage or replacement for structural damage to the metal base of your ring, so please try not to drop a transmission on it. Keep your fingers safe.\n\n**We do not offer coverage for lost or damaged precious stones.\n\n2 Free Reseal and Re-Polishes: We understand you love your ring and want to wear it everyday. If it gets worn and scuffed, send it back for a reseal and polish and we will send it back fresh and clean!\n\nDiscounts:\n\n60% OFF Resizing Remakes:  Due to the natural material used in your handcrafted ring, resizing your ring actually means rebuilding the ring from scratch. With the purchase of our lifetime-limited warranty, you will receive a 60% discount on your new, resized ring in exchange for your original ring.\n\n20% OFF Remakes Due to Structural Damage: Although we cannot cover against structural damage to the base metal of your ring, we understand accidents happen and will offer 20% off the remake of a new ring. \n\nIf you would like to purchase the warranty with your ring you will be provided the option to do so from the Material & Warranty drop down menu.\n\nOTHER GIFTS: We also offer custom, matching cufflinks for any ring as well as groomsmen&#39;s gifts like hatchets and wood tie bars! Be sure to check out the Cufflinks and Groomsmen&#39;s Gifts sections for additional products.\n\nTo learn about our Care Guidelines for your ring please visit our Policies page.\n\nWe would be honored to craft a unique ring for you so you can WEAR AND BE WILD!\n\n*Rings sized 13+ are subject to an additional charge to account for extra material used to craft the ring. Once your order has completed we will send you an invoice. Please note the price varies depending on the metal you choose for the ring.","creation_tsz":1527630021,"ending_tsz":1538257221,"original_creation_tsz":1444436537,"last_modified_tsz":1527630021,"price":"400.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":15,"sku":[],"tags":["mens wedding band","mens wedding ring","unique mens ring","stagheaddesigns","stag head designs","patina copper ring","antler ring","turquoise ring","wood ring","titanium ring","silver ring","gold band","rose gold band"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Ring"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69152047],"materials":["Turquoise"],"shop_section_id":14069769,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1470423625,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/251288021\/the-element-wood-lined-titanium-band?utm_source=demoapp&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":3113,"num_favorers":155,"shipping_template_id":13409467932,"processing_min":40,"processing_max":50,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1247,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Rings","Wedding & Engagement","Wedding Bands"],"used_manufacturer":false},{"listing_id":553407870,"state":"active","user_id":118115548,"category_id":69152047,"title":"Plain Ring\/ Women Ring\/ Wedding Band\/ Promise Ring\/ Anniversary Ring\/ Lady Ring\/ Polished\/ Dome Shape\/ Silver Ring","description":"This silver ring embodies a simple expression of love which makes the perfect wedding or engagement ring.

All items are painstakingly handcrafted by me at my shop; located right at the heart of the New York City diamond district. The unparalleled jewelry designs I fashion are the product of over two decades of experience; which I earned alongside the world&#39;s most prestigious jewelry makers starting when I was twelve years old. When it comes to my craft, I am committed to use only hand-selected diamonds and high quality fine metals; to bring them together with uncompromised attention to every detail, from the optimal position of each diamond within the item to the symmetry and consistency of its patterns. \nNotwithstanding the superior quality of my jewelry items, I also manage to make them unusually affordable; be assured that you will not find this uncommon combination of value and price anywhere else be it the internet or a retail store. \nWhen you purchase one of my items, you can be assured that the jewelry has been meticulously crafted, thoroughly inspected and proudly approved by somebody who believes absolute perfection is the only way to craft jewelry by hand that will last for generations to come. \n\n\nSpecial Orders  ( DREAM IT .... I&#39;LL MAKE IT...!!)\n\nOk I get it; you want what you want and don&#39;t want to be constrained by the limitations of premade jewelry however well put together it may be. Perhaps you just want to change the diamonds or gold color of an existing item; maybe you want platinum instead of gold, or 14K instead of 18K. Congratulations, Today is your day! All of my items can be customized to match your wishes. How about me creating your own, unique jewelry piece &quot;from scratch&quot; based only on your theme or vision? Whether you want me to craft a jewelry piece you saw in a dream or re-create an endeared item you no longer have, you are in the right place and I am the right craftsman for the job. Let&#39;s talk! Tell me your ideas; I am always enthusiastic about creating unique jewelry items. I assure you that the results of my skilled hands implementing your own design will culminate in a breathtaking, one-of-a-kind masterpiece.\n\n\nFeedback\n\nAs it is the case with most jewelry craftsmen whom are worth their salt, I take great pride in the quality and appearance of the jewelry I make with my own hands. So, when it comes to receiving feedback, I really appreciate to see that my costumers leave 5 stars almost every time. For me, this is more than just great feedback; it is also a way to ensure that all of my customers are completely satisfied with my products and services.\nIf for any reason whatsoever, you believe that your experience with me was anything less than 5 stars worthy. Please let me know why; if possible, before you even leave feedback! I assure you that I would do my very best to address all of your concerns in order to leave you completely satisfied. More than the feedback itself, I strive to provide you with the best jewelry shopping experience possible at every level.\n\nPayments\n\nI gladly accept the following forms of payment:\n\nPAYPAL\n\nCREDIT CARDS\n\nPERSONAL CHECKS\n(Please allow 4 to 5 business days for all personal checks to clear)\n\n\nReturn Policy\n\nI guarantee your complete satisfaction with a 14 day money-back return policy which begins the day you receive the item. If you wish to make a return, please return the item to my business address. Items must be returned in the same exact condition as shipped with original packaging and cert appraisal.","creation_tsz":1527630020,"ending_tsz":1538257220,"original_creation_tsz":1432152843,"last_modified_tsz":1527630020,"price":"3050.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"sku":[],"tags":["engagement ring","diamond ring","cocktail ring","black diamond ring","vintage diamond ring","solitaire ring","color diamond ring","bridal ring","diamond wedding ring","diamond engagement","bridal diamond ring","Unique ring","black gold ring"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Ring"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69152047],"materials":["14 karat white gold","DIAMOND","diamonds","BLACK DIAMONDS","FANCY BLACK DIAMONDS","HANDMADE","NATURAL DIAMOND","FANCY COLOR DIAMONDS","WHITE GOLD","14K","black diamond","black gold","14k black gold"],"shop_section_id":10448564,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1432152843,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/234118953\/diamond-engagement-ring-14k-black-gold?utm_source=demoapp&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":75,"num_favorers":13,"shipping_template_id":9162954314,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":3,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"2010_2018","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"women","occasion":"engagement","style":["Art Deco"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","should_auto_renew":true,"language":"en-US","has_variations":true,"taxonomy_id":1245,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Rings","Wedding & Engagement","Engagement Rings"],"used_manufacturer":false}],"params":{"limit":25,"offset":0,"page":null,"keywords":"&quot;Weddings, Ring&quot;","sort_on":"created","sort_order":"down","min_price":null,"max_price":null,"color":null,"color_accuracy":0,"tags":null,"category":null,"location":null,"lat":null,"lon":null,"region":null,"geo_level":"city","accepts_gift_cards":"false","translate_keywords":"false"},
